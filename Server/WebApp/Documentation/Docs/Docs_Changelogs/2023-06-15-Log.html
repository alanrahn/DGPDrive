    <div class="titlediv">DGP HTTP Web Services</div>
    <div class="innerdiv">
        <table class="doctable">
            <tr><th class="functionality">Name</th><th class="description">Description</th><th class="status">Status</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Beta Release 0.9</td><td>The initial beta release of the DGP HTTP Web Services</td><td class="completed">Beta</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            The HTTP web services are the equivalent of identical services that were used in production systems at various companies.  They rely on TLS to encrypt the API messages during transport,
            and they rely on SQL Server Availability Groups to provide fault-tolerance and optional 100% system uptime.  They have been thoroughly tested and are now Beta.

    <div class="titlediv">DGP SOAP Web Services</div>
    <div class="innerdiv">
        <table class="doctable">
            <tr><th class="functionality">Name</th><th class="description">Description</th><th class="status">Status</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Beta Release 0.9</td><td>The initial alpha release of the DGP SOAP Web Services</td><td class="pending">Alpha</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            The SOAP web services are being added to the DGPDrive system to include two types of functionality.  First, they add built-in encryption of the API messages using
            a PGP style of hybrid cryptosystem (a combination of RSA asymmetric encryption and AES symmetric encryption) as an alternative to TLS.  Second, they add one-way methods
            using the request/acknowledge pattern (which is only provided by the SOAP protocol) for multi-threaded parallel execution of the many iterations of various automated processes.

    <div class="titlediv">AutoWork Application</div>
    <div class="innerdiv">
        <table class="doctable">
            <tr><th class="functionality">Name</th><th class="description">Description</th><th class="status">Status</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Beta Release 0.9</td><td>The initial beta release of the AutoWork application</td><td class="pending">Alpha</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            The AutoWork subsystem requires a very reliable, scalable and performant mechanism for the multi-threaded parallel execution of many process iterations.  The third version of this subsystem is currently in progress.
            The first version attempted to use HTTP web services as one-way methods to run iterations of the automated processes.  This functionality worked at a small scale, but failed during load tests (unhandled HTTP exceptions crashed the service).
            The second version built the multi-threading into the AutoWork Windows service using the .NET task parallel library (specifically parallel foreach).  This functionality also worked at a small scale, but failed during load tests (.NET private thread pools malfunctioned).
            The third version is currently in progress, and is being built using SOAP one-way web service methods (request/acknowledge pattern), which allows the AutoWork Windows service to return to being a simple scheduler application.
