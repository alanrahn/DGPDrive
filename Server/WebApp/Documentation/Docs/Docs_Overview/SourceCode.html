    <div class="titlediv">DGPDrive Source Code</div>
    <p>The Azure Git source code repository is private by default, and this is where all DGPDrive development occurrs.  For convenience and ease of use, it includes config files that contain private information such as ADO.NET connections strings for the dev and test environments, etc.
    Both the GitHub and SourceForge repositories are public by default, and contain sanitized versions of the Azure repository (removing private info from the various .config files) and are updated periodically.  SourceForge provides a way to sync projects from GitHub, so it is basically a clone of the GitHub repository.
    All DGP and DGPDrive documentation is embedded in the source code as the documentation web application.  It is updated as part of each "release" to insure that it remains in sync with the changes made to the source code (refer to the change logs for more info).</p>
